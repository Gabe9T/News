TODO 
want to have the page on load to show stored stories already in firebase from that day 
Have a calender that you can choose the day and it routes to that days stories (for ex: if you choose 4-15-24 it uses a route to make the site route sitename/4-15-24 )

strech goals 
have a minified way to read stories. maybe theres a tool that summerizes text/
adding a picture that is genrates based off of story text?
